# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [ ] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

### Jest vs Cypress
* Jest
  * command line test runner
  * mostly based around assertions
  * unit and integration testing

* Cypress
  * browser-based
  * rare that we'll use assertions
  * e2e testing
  * takes 100x as long
